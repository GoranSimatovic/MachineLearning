Look-up for standard DS/ML methodologies

This is a repository for standard methods in data science/machine learning. I use the old faithful Titanic dataset which is available all around. Both NeuralNetwork and some standards classifiers are used. THIS IS ONLY A LOOKUP, I did not have the time to put up cool methods for data preprocessing, code pipelines or data visualization. Sorry..
