Look-up for standard DS/ML methodologies

This is a repository for standard methods in data science/machine learning. Usual Logit and RandomForest with their different feature selection methodologies are shown. Also a very simple NN is there to keep a working version available as these things change quickly. Again THIS IS ONLY A LOOKUP for myself, I did not have the time to put up cool methods for data preprocessing, code pipelines or data visualization. Sorry..
