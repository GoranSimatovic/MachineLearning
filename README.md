# Look-up for standard DS/ML methodologies

This is a small repository for standard methods in data science/machine learning. It is PERMANENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

Current code examples:

* logisticRegression with performance and correlation based optimization
* randomForest with feature selection using importance/GINI effect
* simple NN to keep a working version available as these things change quickly
* voter classifier with a 'mistake sharing' example

As usual all the fun stuff happens in the support functions :) Again THIS IS ONLY A LOOKUP for myself, I did not have the time to put up cool methods for data preprocessing, code pipelines or data visualization. Sorry..
